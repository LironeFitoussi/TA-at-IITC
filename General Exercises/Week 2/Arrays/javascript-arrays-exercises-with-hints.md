# JavaScript Array Exercises

1. Create an array called `fruits` with three favorite fruits.
   Hint: Use square brackets `[]` to create an array.

2. Add a new fruit to the end of the `fruits` array using the `push()` method.
   Hint: `arrayName.push(newElement)` adds an element to the end.

3. Remove the last fruit from the `fruits` array using the `pop()` method and store it in a variable called `lastFruit`.
   Hint: `var lastItem = arrayName.pop()` removes and returns the last element.

4. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5. Then, use `console.log()` to print the third element of this array.
   Hint: Array indices start at 0, so the third element is at index 2.

5. Change the second element of your `fruits` array to "kiwi".
   Hint: Use array indexing to modify an element: `arrayName[1] = "kiwi"`.

6. Create an empty array called `colors`. Then add "red", "green", and "blue" to it using the `push()` method.
   Hint: You can chain multiple `push()` calls or use one with multiple arguments.

7. Remove the first element from your `colors` array using the `shift()` method.
   Hint: `arrayName.shift()` removes the first element and returns it.

8. Add "yellow" to the beginning of your `colors` array using the `unshift()` method.
   Hint: `arrayName.unshift(newElement)` adds an element to the beginning.

9. Create an array of numbers and use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
   Hint: Initialize a sum variable to 0, then add each array element to it in the loop.
   [Learn more about for loops](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)

10. Use the `indexOf()` method to find the position of "green" in your `colors` array.
    Hint: `arrayName.indexOf(element)` returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.

11. Create an array of five random numbers. Then use a `for` loop to find and console.log the largest number in the array.
    Hint: Initialize a variable with the first element, then compare it with other elements in the loop.

12. Use the `slice()` method to create a new array containing the second and third elements of your `fruits` array.
    Hint: `arrayName.slice(startIndex, endIndex)` extracts a portion of an array.

13. Create an array of numbers. Use the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only the even numbers.
    Hint: The callback function for `filter()` should return `true` for even numbers.

14. Use the `join()` method to convert your `colors` array into a string where colors are separated by commas.
    Hint: `arrayName.join(separator)` joins all elements into a string.
    [Learn more about join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp)

15. Create two arrays of numbers. Use the `concat()` method to combine them into a single array.
    Hint: `array1.concat(array2)` combines two arrays.
    [Learn more about concat()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_concat_array.asp)

16. Use the `reverse()` method to reverse the order of elements in your `fruits` array.
    Hint: `arrayName.reverse()` reverses the array in place.
    [Learn more about reverse()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp)

17. Create an array of names. Use the `map()` method to create a new array where each name is prefixed with "Hello, ".
    Hint: The callback function for `map()` should return the modified string.
    [Learn more about map()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp)

18. Use the `every()` method to check if all numbers in an array are greater than 0.
    Hint: The callback function for `every()` should return a boolean.
    [Learn more about every()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_every.asp)

19. Create an array of numbers. Use the `find()` method to get the first number greater than 10.
    Hint: The callback function for `find()` should return `true` for the desired element.
    [Learn more about find()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_find.asp)

20. Use the `some()` method to check if your `fruits` array contains the fruit "banana".
    Hint: The callback function for `some()` should return `true` if the element is "banana".

21. Create an array of numbers. Use the `reduce()` method to calculate the product of all numbers in the array.
    Hint: The callback function for `reduce()` should multiply the accumulator by the current value.
    [Learn more about reduce()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reduce.asp)

22. Use a `for` loop to create an array containing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
    Hint: Initialize an empty array and use `push()` inside the loop to add squared values.
    [Learn more about for loops](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)

23. Create an array of words. Use the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only words with more than 5 letters.
    Hint: The callback function for `filter()` should check the length of each word.

24. Use the `includes()` method to check if your `colors` array includes the color "purple".
    Hint: `arrayName.includes(element)` returns `true` if the element is in the array.
    [Learn more about includes()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_includes_array.asp)

25. Create a 2D array representing a tic-tac-toe board. Fill it with "X", "O", and empty strings. Then, write a function that console.logs the board in a readable format.
    Hint: Use nested arrays to create a 2D array. Use nested loops to print the board.
