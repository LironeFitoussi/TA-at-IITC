# Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming Exercises

This section contains **30 simple exercises** focused on the basics of **asynchronous** and **synchronous** programming. These exercises involve loops, setTimeout, and basic code flow understanding. The second part contains solutions for these exercises.

---

### 1. **Synchronous Console Logging**
Log "Start", "Middle", and "End" to the console in the correct sequence.

---

### 2. **Using setTimeout with Delayed Output**
Log "Start" immediately, then log "End" after 1 second.

---

### 3. **Delayed Logging with setTimeout**
Log "Waiting..." after 2 seconds.

---

### 4. **Loop with setTimeout (Incorrect Order)**
Create a `for` loop that logs numbers 1 through 3 with a 1-second delay between each log.  
(Hint: This won't work as expected.)

---

### 5. **Correct Loop with setTimeout and Closure**
Fix the loop from the previous exercise to correctly log numbers 1 through 3 with a 1-second delay between each.

---

### 6. **Synchronous Blocking Example**
Log "Start", run a loop that blocks the main thread for 2 seconds, then log "End".

---

### 7. **Basic Asynchronous with setTimeout**
Log "Start", wait 1 second, and then log "End".

---

### 8. **Asynchronous Message with Multiple setTimeouts**
Log "First" after 1 second, "Second" after 2 seconds, and "Third" after 3 seconds.

---

### 9. **setTimeout Inside a Function**
Create a function `delayedMessage()` that logs "Hello after 2 seconds" after 2 seconds.

---

### 10. **Immediate Execution vs Delayed Execution**
Log "Start", then set two `setTimeout` calls: one for 1 second and another for 0 seconds, followed by logging "End".

---

### 11. **Synchronous Loop with Delayed Logging**
Run a loop to log numbers 1 to 3 immediately, then log "Done!" after the loop.

---

### 12. **setTimeout with Dynamic Delay**
Log "Message 1" after 1 second, "Message 2" after 2 seconds, and so on for 5 messages.

---

### 13. **Synchronous Function Execution**
Call three functions (`a`, `b`, `c`) in sequence. They should each log their own name.

---

### 14. **setTimeout Inside a Loop (With Function Scope)**
Log numbers 1 to 3, with each number being logged after 1 second.

---

### 15. **setTimeout Without Delay**
Create a `setTimeout` with a delay of 0 and log "This will run last!" after all synchronous code.

---

### 16. **Simulating Long Task**
Log "Start", simulate a long task with a loop that takes 3 seconds, then log "End".

---

### 17. **Simulate Asynchronous Loading**
Log "Loading...", and after 2 seconds, log "Data loaded!".

---

### 18. **Loop with Multiple setTimeout Calls**
Log "Task 1" after 1 second, "Task 2" after 2 seconds, and "Task 3" after 3 seconds.

---

### 19. **Synchronous Execution with Loops**
Log "Start", run a loop to log numbers from 1 to 5, then log "End".

---

### 20. **Delaying a Function with setTimeout**
Write a function `delayLog()` that takes a message and logs it after a 2-second delay.

---

### 21. **Loop with a Delayed Start**
Start logging numbers from 1 to 5 after 2 seconds.

---

### 22. **Multiple setTimeouts with Overlapping Delays**
Log "First" after 1 second, "Second" after 1.5 seconds, and "Third" after 2 seconds.

---

### 23. **Long Loop with Immediate setTimeout**
Log numbers from 1 to 5 with no delay, but log "Done!" after the loop with a 0ms timeout.

---

### 24. **setTimeout with Large Delay**
Log "Waiting..." after 5 seconds.

---

### 25. **Synchronous and Asynchronous Mix**
Log "Start", then log numbers from 1 to 3 with `setTimeout`, then log "End".

---

### 26. **Simulate Delayed Network Request**
Log "Sending request...", and after 3 seconds, log "Request complete".

---

### 27. **setTimeout with Repeating Pattern**
Log "Hello" every second for 5 seconds.

---

### 28. **Logging Numbers After Delay**
Log numbers 1 through 4, but log each number after its corresponding second delay (1 second for 1, 2 seconds for 2, etc.).

---

### 29. **Basic Countdown**
Log "3", "2", "1", "Go!" in sequence, with each number logged after a 1-second delay.

---

### 30. **Immediate setTimeout with Synchronous Code**
Log "Start", use `setTimeout` with a 0ms delay, then log "Middle", followed by "End".
